# Quiz-Management-System

## Project Summary:
This is a simple role-based **Quiz Management System** developed using **Java**. It supports two types of users: `admin` and `student`.

- The **admin** can add multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to a question bank.
- The **student** can take a 10-question quiz based on those MCQs.

The system uses JSON files for data persistence:
- `users.json`: stores user credentials and roles.
- `quiz.json`: stores all quiz questions and answer keys.
